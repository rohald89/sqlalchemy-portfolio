## Overview
---
<br />

### The challenge
<br />
Users should be able to:

- View a page of projects 
- View a details page with more information about a specific project
- Add new projects to the database
- Edit existing projects from the database
- Delete a project from the database

Other features: 

- Routing for the different pages
- Templates are using a layout.html file for the repeated code
- 404 error handling
- Clean code following PEP8 standards

<br />

### Run the project locally

- Download the project files
- Start up a virtual environment in the project folder
- Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file
- run `app.py` file 
- the page will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## My process
<br />

### Built with

- Python
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

<br />

### What I learned

This was the first project I created using Flask so I've learned quite a bit about things like creating routes and using templates using Flask. Having created backend projects using Node / Express before it wasn't completely new to me but it was great to see how Flask handles these things. 

<br />

### Continued development

I've really enjoyed working with Flask and coming from a JavaScript / Node background I certainly see myself using Flask more often in the future. I'd love to dive deeper into the possibilities with Flask and SQLAlchemy with things like authentication and relational databases.
