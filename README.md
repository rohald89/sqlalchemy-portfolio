## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View a page of projects 
- View a details page with more information about a specific project
- Add new projects to the database
- Edit existing projects from the database
- Delete a project from the database

This project also includes: 

- Routing for the different pages
- Templates are using a layout.html file for the repeated code
- 404 error handling
- Clean code following PEP8 standards

### Run the project locally

<!-- TODO: EXPLANATION ON HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT LOCALLY -->

### Screenshot

<!-- TODO: ADD SCREENSHOT -->
![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Python
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)


### What I learned

<!-- TODO: What I've learned during this project -->

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I've really enjoyed working with Flask and coming from a JavaScript / Node background I certainly see myself using Flask more often in the future. I'd love to dive deeper into the possibilities with Flask and SQLAlchemy with things like authentication and relational databases. 

### Useful resources

<!-- TODO: KEEP TRACK OF RESOURCES USED DURING DEVELOPMENT -->

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
